# Task Flow

**Task Flow** is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to efficiently manage tasks. The app allows users to **add**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks, providing a simple interface to keep track of to-do items. The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern and uses **SQLite** for local data storage.

## Features
- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
- **Edit Task**: Users can update existing tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Tasks can be removed from the list.
- **Task List**: The list of tasks is displayed using a `ListView`, showing task titles and due dates.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored locally in a SQLite database, ensuring data persistence even when the app is closed.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile from a single codebase.
- **Dart**: The programming language used for Flutter development.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight local database for storing task data.
- **Provider**: State management package to manage and update UI based on the data.
- **sqflite**: Flutter plugin for SQLite database access.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A clean architecture pattern used to separate concerns in the app.

Deleting a Task

Swipe left on a task or press the delete icon to remove it from the list.

Architecture

Task Flow follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, which separates the UI logic from business logic.

Model: The model contains the task data and the SQLite database interaction.

View: The view is the UI that displays the task list and individual task details.

ViewModel: The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the View and Model, managing the task data and providing it to the View.

SQLite Database Schema

The app uses a simple SQLite schema with the following table:

Tasks Table

id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (auto-incremented)
title: TEXT (Task title)
description: TEXT (Task description)
dueDate: TEXT (Task due date)

### Notes:
1. **App Name**: I've used `Task Flow` as the app's name in the README.

2. **GitHub URL**: Replace the clone URL (`https://github.com/smThilshan/task_flow.git`) with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
3. **Known Issues**: You can add any issues youâ€™ve encountered or leave it blank if there are no issues.
